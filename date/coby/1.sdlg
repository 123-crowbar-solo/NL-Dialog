You decide you should see what Captain Coby is up to. You haven't seen him around the base in the past few hours, so you decide to check his office.
do set_background("office", show)
do show_character(coby, center, show)
Sure enough, he's there and looking rather...frazzled, to say the least.
do increment("cd1_possible")
- Captain? Is everything ok? => Coby_notice1
- Excuse me, sir, is now a good time? => Coby_notice1
- What's got you in a twist?
    do increment("cd1_points")
    => Coby_casual1

:: Coby_notice1
Coby: Oh! `name`! I didn't see you there. Yes, I'm just trying to get a handle on all of this... Though now that you're here I may take this opportunity to take a bit of a break. And please, there's no need for formalities.
- You certainly look like you need one...
    Coby: Oh boy, do I? => Coby_choice
- Are you sure that's alright?
    Coby: Of course! Probably. I can always have Helmeppo help me later. => Coby_choice
- Hey, I'm not letting you use me as an excuse.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Ah, sorry, you're right. I should get back to work... => End_Date

:: Coby_casual1
Coby: Paperwork. As usual. I really don't understand how others get theirs done so quickly...
- Maybe you should take a break for a bit. Come back later.
    Coby: Maybe you're right... I'm not going to get anything done like this... => Coby_choice
- Well. Good luck.
    Coby: Thanks. I'm going to need it... => End_Date

:: Coby_choice
Coby: It's funny, even though I need a break I have no idea what we should do...
- Have you had anything to eat?
    Coby: Not for a while... Food sounds really good right now, though... => Coby_food1
- I've been interested in training with you. Could be good to stretch your legs.
    Coby: Oh, that's a great idea! Seas know I need to move. => Coby_training1

:: Coby_food1
do set_background("park", fade)
You walk with him down to the mess hall, listening to Coby's stomach growl. He said he hadn't eaten in a while, but you can't help but wonder how long â€˜a while' actually was... No wonder he wasn't getting any work done.
- Do you know what they're serving today?
    Coby: No idea... Something good, I hope. => Coby_food2
- How did you manage to forget to eat for so long?
    Coby: I tend to lose track of time while I'm working. There's usually someone to remind me but he's had other things to do.
    `name`: Helmeppo?
    Coby: Helmeppo... => Coby_food2
- How did you end up with so much paperwork anyways?
    Coby: I have no idea! I don't remember there being so much...
    Coby: Honestly I wouldn't put it past Garp to have mixed his in with mine... It would certainly explain some things... => Coby_food2

do set_background("mess-hall", fade)
You both enter the mess hall and are met with a delightful smell.
Coby: Oh! Buttered potatoes! I would've come down earlier if I knew this is what they had today!

- Oh man, now I'm hungry too!
    do increment("cd1_points")

    Coby: They're my favorite! => Coby_foodchoice
- Ew. I hope they have something else.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Yeah they usually have options. => Coby_foodchoice

:: Coby_foodchoice
He leads the way up to the counter and grabs two trays, handing one back to you as he looks over the choices. You look as well, weighing your food options from what is available.
do increment("cd1_possible")
- Get the buttered potato meal.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    => Coby_Potatoes
- Get the pasta. => Coby_Pasta
- Skip straight to dessert and get the cake. => Coby_Cake

:: Coby_Potatoes
You both sit down at one of the empty tables after getting your food.
Coby: Oh! Good choice! The buttered potatoes are always amazing. You'll have to tell me what you think.
do increment("cd1_possible")
- Wow, they are really good!
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: I'm glad you like them! => Coby_food3
- They're ok. Not my favorite, but I'm glad I tried them.
    Coby: Fair enough. I know it's not everyone's thing. => Coby_food3
- Eugh. I really should've gotten something else...
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Ah... => Coby_food3

:: Coby_Pasta
You both sit down at one of the empty tables after getting your food.
Coby: Wow, that looks really good too! I've always wanted to try it, but it always seems to be here on buttered potatoes day.
do increment("cd1_possible")
- It's great! Want to try some?
    do increment("cd1_points")
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: Really? Sure!
    Coby: ...
    Coby: Wow! That is good! => Coby_food3
- It is good, but honestly you're not missing too much.
    Coby: Yeah? Well, good to know. => Coby_food3
- It's way better than what you got.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Hah, you sound like Helmeppo.
    Coby: He doesn't like them either... => Coby_food3

:: Coby_Cake
You both sit down at one of the empty tables after getting your food.
Coby: Went straight for dessert, huh? I don't blame you, the cake is always delicious.
do increment("cd1_possible")
- It really is. They always make it so moist.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: *Right*? => Coby_food3
- I'm not a huge cake fan, but it is pretty nice. => Coby_food3
- I just wish they had a different flavor. This kind is kinda gross.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Well, tomorrow they'll have something different. => Coby_food3

:: Coby_food3
Both of you eat in silence for a little while. The captain seems content to stay occupied with his food, but your mind wanders. If there was ever a perfect chance to get to know him better, it would be now.
- (Eat silently) => Coby_food4
- So. What's it like being a Captain? => Coby_Captain
- Does the goat get into the file room a lot? => Coby_Goat
- Your friend Helmeppo is kind of a bitch. => Coby_Helmeppo

:: Coby_Captain
Coby: It's hard work, but I really enjoy it. My crew has been amazing and it's nice to be able to trust them to have my back. I don't think I'll ever get used to the paperwork, though...
do increment("cd1_possible")
- It may be a pain, but it does have its uses. Things would be a mess without any.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: Of course. But sometimes it feels like I'm filling out the same information over and over... => Coby_food4
- Yeah the paperwork sucks. Most of the time it just feels redundant.
    Coby: It does. I don't see why departments can't just use one form so we can fill it out once and copy it... => Coby_food4
- Don't you have better things to do than complain about paperwork?
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Yes. But I've learned that venting can be a bit therapeutic.  => Coby_food4

:: Coby_Goat
Coby: Sometimes. Usually it stays with Sengoku, but it seems to be getting a bit more adventurous lately. Especially since Drake has come back. I think it missed him a bit...
- That's so sweet!
    Coby: Yeah. Of course I can't exactly say if it's true or not, since I'm pretty sure Helmeppo's also been feeding it old paperwork... => Coby_food4
- Understandable. I'd probably miss him too.
    Coby: Same here if I knew him that long. => Coby_food4
- Do you really think a goat can miss someone like that?
    Coby: I don't know enough goats to know overall, but this one most definitely would. => Coby_food4

:: Coby_Helmeppo
Coby: Oh he's *such* a bitch.
Coby: All jokes aside, he's actually pretty cool once you get to know him. He's just...
Coby: An acquired taste...
do increment("cd1_possible")
- Oh. I guess maybe I judged him too soon.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: Fair warning though, he's still pretty abrasive even when you know him. => Coby_food4
- I'll take your word for it...
    Coby: That's all I can ask. => Coby_food4
- And that's a taste I'd rather not acquire.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Well you don't need to be rude about it. => Coby_food4

:: Coby_food4
Coby: What about you? How are you liking working here so far?
do increment("cd1_possible")
- I'm really enjoying it. Everyone's been so nice so far, and those that aren't are at least polite.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: That's so good to hear! => Coby_food5
- It's alright. Getting used to things has been hard, but I'm sure things will get better.
    do increment("cd1_points")
    do increment("cd1_points")
    Coby: I know how you feel. I know I felt like I'd been thrown in with the sharks when I first arrived. But it does get easier. => Coby_food5
- Honestly, I wish I'd stayed where I was. Less going on.
    Coby: Understandable, it can be pretty hectic here and I know that's not for everyone. => Coby_food5
- I hate it here. I transferred for my career but I wish I'd been placed somewhere better.
    do decrement("cd1_points")
    Coby: Ah, I see... => Coby_food5

:: Coby_food5
You both finish eating and Coby sighs.
Coby: Wow, I really needed that...
Coby: I guess I should get back to work now, though, shouldn't I?
- Probably. I can walk back with you, if you'd like.
    Coby: Well I'm not about to say no to that. => Coby_food6
- Good luck. I think I'm going to stay here a bit longer.
    Coby: Alright. I'll see you around, then. => End_Date

You walk with Coby back towards his office. On the way he tells you a story from his early days as a Marine.

    Coby: True! I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's one of the funnier things that happened to us back then. => Coby_food_ending

You take a swing at his face and he leans to the side, reaching up to quickly grab your arm and flip you on your back. As soon as he does, Coby cringes.

He pulls you back onto your feet

You rush him and bring your leg up in an attempt to knee him in the groin. Before you are able to connect, Coby sidesteps and elbows you in the side, knocking you off-balance.
